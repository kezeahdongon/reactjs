  /*
  WHAT ARE COMPONENTS? AND WHY IS REACT ALL ABOUT THEM?
		- REACT MAKES BUILDING COMPLEX, INTERACTIVE, AND REACTIVE USER INTERFACE SIMPLER
		- REACT IS ALL ABOUT "COMPONENTS". (ALL USER INTERFACES ARE MADE UP OF COMPONENTS)
			- COMPONENTS ARE THE REUSABLE BUILDING BLOCKS IN THE USER INTERFACE
			- COMPONENTS ARE MADE OF HTML, CSS FOR STYLING, AND JAVASCRIPT FOR CODING
		- WHY COMPONENTS?
			- BECAUSE OF ITS REUSABILITY WHERE WE DON'T REPEAT OURSELVES
			- BECAUSE OF THE SEPARATION OF CONCERNS WHERE WE DON'T DO TOO MANY THINGS IN ONE AND THE SAME PLACE (FUNCTION)
		- REACT SPLIT BIG CHUNKS OF CODE INTO MULTIPLE SMALLER FUNCTIONS
