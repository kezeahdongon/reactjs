    <!-- 
        What are "Custom Hooks"?
            Custom hooks are regular functions just as the built in hooks like useStates 
            or functions but they are functions which contains stateful logics. 

            - outsosurce stateful logic into re-usable functions.
            - unlike "regular fuctions", custom hooks can use other react hooks and react state.

    <!-- 
        you can return what ever you want to return to your custom hooks
            it can be: array, object, number, or a state stored in const component.
