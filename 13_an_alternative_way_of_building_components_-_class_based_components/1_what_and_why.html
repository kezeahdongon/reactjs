        What & Why:
            Class-based Components: An Alternative to Functions
                Functional Components -- Default & most Modern Approach

                    function Product(props){
                        return <h2>A Product!</h2>
                    };

                    - Components are regular javascript functions which return renderable results (typically JSX).

                Class-based Components -- Was Required in the Past
                    
                    class Product extends Component{
                        render(){
                            return <h2>A Product!</h2>
                        }
                    };

                    - Components can also be defined as JS classes where a render() methos defines the to-be-rendered output.

            - Traditionally (React < 16.8), you had to use class-based components to manage "state".
            - React 16.8 introduced "React Hooks" for Functional Components
            - Class-based Components Can't use React Hooks.
