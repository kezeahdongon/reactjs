        Class-based Component Lifecycle
            Side-Effects in Functional Components: useEffect()
            Class-based Components cannot use React Hooks.

                componentDidMount()
                    Called once component mounted (was evaluated & rendered)
                        useEffect(..., [])

                componentDidUpdate()
                    Called once component updated (was evaluated & rendered)
                        useEffect(..., [someValue])

                componentWillUnmount()
                    Called once before the component is unmounted (removed from DOM)
                        useEffect(() => {
                            return () => {
                                ...
                            }
                        }, [])
