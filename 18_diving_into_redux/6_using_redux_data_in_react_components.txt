- in the counter.js file inside the components,
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux';

- then use the useSelector function to call a function from store.
const counter = useSelector(state => state.counter); 
  // useSelector() calls a function w/c is basically determines what piece of data we want to extract from store.
  
- and then assign the {counter} to the counter UI
