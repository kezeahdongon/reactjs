To provide the redux store to react app...

    - Go to index.js file in the main folder where we render the entire app to the 
    highest level we can go in the react application to the top of the component 
    tree where we render the root component.

    - import { Provider } from 'react-redux';

    - wrap the root component with <Provider />
    ReactDOM.render(<Provider><App /></Provider>, document.getElementById('root'));

    - import store and in the <Provider /> we put a store prop and it needs a value which is our redux store
    import store from './store/index';
    ReactDOM.render(<Provider store={store}><App /></Provider>, document.getElementById('root'));
