What is Redux toolkit?
    - Redux Toolkit is our official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for 
    efficient Redux development. It also includes the most widely used Redux addons, 
    like Redux Thunk for async logic and Reselect for writing selector functions, 
    so that you can use them right away.
