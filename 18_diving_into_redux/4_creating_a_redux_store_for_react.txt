*create a folder "store" inside the "scr" folder.
    - it is a common convention to store your redux-related code files 
    in a 'store' folder inside the 'scr' folder, and inside the 'store' 
    folder create a 'index.js' file to store your redux logics.
    
    - And in the index.js we create a store, and create a reducer for 
    the counter and then export the store.
    

import { createStore } from "redux";

const counterReducer = (state = {counter: 0}, action) => {
    if (action.type === 'increment') {
        return {
            counter: state.counter + 1
        }
    };

    if (action.type === 'decrement') {
        return {
            counter: state.counter - 1
        }
    };

    return state;
};

const store = createStore(counterReducer);

export default store;
