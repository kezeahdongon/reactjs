- the objects which we return to the reducer WILL not be merged with the existing state
they WILL OVERWRITE the existing state.

- in working with redux, you should NEVER MUTATE THE EXISTING STATE.
Instead, ALWAYS OVERWRITE IT WITH A BRAND NEW STATE OBJECT.

- mutating the state can lead to bugs, unpredictable behavior, and it can make debugging
the application harder. So even though it doesn't leads to a bug here, it can have unwanted 
and unexpected side-effects in bigger applications where your states gets out of sync and
suddenly the UI is not reflecting your state anymore.
