        MODULE INTRODUCTION:
            Redux (third party react library)

        UNDERSTANDING REDUX
            - managing App-Wide State with Redux

            WHAT IS REDUX? AND WHY?
                -   Redux is a predictable state container 
                    designed to help you write JavaScript apps 
                    that behave consistently across client, server, 
                    and native environments and are easy to test. 
                    While it's mostly used as a state management tool with React, 
                    you can use it with any other JavaScript framework or library.

                -   A state management system for cross-component or app-wide state. 
                    it helps us manage state, data that changes and affects the application
                    and what we display on the screen, it helps us manage such data 
                    across multiple components or even the complete app.

            WHAT IS CROSS-COMPONENT / APP-WIDE STATE?
                -   react hooks exist to allow us to manage data that typically changes 
                    and typically leads to the UI being updated.

                -   we use state management react hooks like useState so we can tell react 
                    that some data changed and so it updates the UI for us. 

                3 main kinds of state:
                    1. Local State
                        - State that belong to a single component.
                            ex: listening to user input in a input field;
                                toggling a "show more" details field.
                        - should be managed component-internal with useState() / useReducer()
                    2. cross-Component State
                        - state that affects multiple components.
                            ex: open / close state of a modal overlay.
                        - requires "prop chains" / "props drilling"
                    3. App-Wide state
                        - state that affects the entire app (most / all components)
                            ex: user authentication status.
                        - requires "prop chains" / "props drilling"

            REDUX BASICS & USING REDUX WITH REACT
                - Redux can integrate with any UI framework, and is most frequently used with React.

            REACT CONTEXT - POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGES
                -   Complex setup / management
                    - it depends on the kind of application which is built
                    - in more complex apps, managing React Context can lead to deeply nested JSX code and/or huge "Context Provider" components.
                
                -   Performance
                    - React context is not optimized for high-frequency state changes
