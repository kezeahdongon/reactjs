EXPLORING THE CORE REDUX Concepts

    The Reducer function
        - is a standard JavaScript function but it will be called by the 
        redux library and it will always receive two pieces of input 
        parameters the old/existing state and the action that is dispatched.
            --Inputs: Old state + Dispatched Action
        
        - Then this reducer function must return a certain output, it must
        always return a new state object.
            --Output: New State Object

        - Therefore, a reducer function should be a pure function which basically
        means that the same values for the inputs always should produce exactly
        the same output and there should be no side-effectsinside of that function.
        So you must not send http request or write somethinf to local storage or
        fetch something from local storage, instead, a reducer should really just 
        be a function that takes the given inputs which are provided by redux and
        then produces the expected output, a new state object.

        const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
            return 
        };
            - the reducer will receive (state, action) by default.
            and then we shall return the new state or replace the existing state
