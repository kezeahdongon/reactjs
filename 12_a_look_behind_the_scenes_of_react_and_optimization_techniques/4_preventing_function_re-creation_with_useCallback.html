    <title>Preventing Function Re-Creation With useCallback()</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- 
        useCallback is a hook that allows us to basically store a function across component execution, 
        so it allows us to tell React that we want to save a function and this function should not be re-created with every execution.
