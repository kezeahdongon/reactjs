        MODULE:
        - How React Work Behind the Scene?
            - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
            - it is composed of components which are used to build user interfaces.
            - ReactDOM is the REACT INTERFACE TO THE WEB.
                NOTE: ReactJS it self does not know the web. It doest not know about the browser.
            - Real DOM is what the user sees
            - React determines how the component tree currently looks like and what it should look like.
            - ReactDOM receives the differences and then manipulates the real DOM

            WHAT REACT CARES ABOUT or THE CORE FEATURES OF REACT?
            - React only care about components and props which is data from parent componentto make components configurable 
            and to enable parent-child communication.
            - React care aboout state which is the internal data inside the component.
            - React cares about the context which is component-wide data

        NOTE: Re-Evaluating Components !== Re-Rendering the DOM
            - COMPONENTS are re-evaluted whenever props, state or context changes.
            React executes component functions again
            - on the otherhand, changes to the real DOM are only made for differences between evaluations

            VIRTUAL DOM DIFFING:
                React DOM only insert the new changes to the DOM
                example:
                    previous evaluation result

                        <div>
                            <h1>Hi There!</h1>
                        </div>

                    current evaluation result

                        <div>
                            <h1>Hi There!</h1>
                            <p>This is new!</p> // Changes are required <p> should be inserted in DOM (the rest should stay unchanged)
                        </div>
