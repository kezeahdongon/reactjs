        useCallback() allows you to save a function so that you can reuse it.
            - react store the exact function and store it in a memory so when the function is re-evaluated it will not run.

        "IN JAVASCRIPT, FUNCTIONS ARE CLOSURE."

        - Closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with 
        references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). 
        In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 
        In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

        - Lexical Scoping:
            function init() {
            var name = 'Mozilla'; // name is a local variable created by init
            function displayName() { // displayName() is the inner function, a closure
                alert(name); // use variable declared in the parent function
            }
            displayName();
            }
            init();

            - init() creates a local variable called name and a function called displayName(). 
            The displayName() function is an inner function that is defined inside init() and 
            is available only within the body of the init() function. Note that the displayName() 
            function has no local variables of its own. However, since inner functions have access 
            to the variables of outer functions, displayName() can access the variable name declared 
            in the parent function, init().

            - The word lexical refers to the fact that lexical scoping uses the location where a variable 
            is declared within the source code to determine where that variable is available.
