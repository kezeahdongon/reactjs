    <!-- 
        WHAT ARE PREMITIVES?
            var age = 28;

            - The age variable (you could also use let or const by the way) stores a number value. The number 28.
            - Number values are called "primitive values" because they're very simple building blocks of JavaScript apps.

            other simple core building blocks:

            var name = 'Max' // strings are primitives, too!
            var isMale = true // so are booleans        

            // So numbers, string, booleans - these are probably very well-known to you. undefined and null are additional primitive types.
    -->

    <!-- 
        WHAT ARE REFERENCE TYPE?
            objects and arrays are the reference type.

            var person = {
            name: 'Max',
            age: 28,
            }

            var hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking']

            - Here, person is an object and therefore a so-called reference type. 
            Please note that it holds properties that in turn have primitive values. 
            This doesn't affect the object being a reference type though. 
            And you could of course also have nested objects or arrays inside the person object.

            - The hobbies array is also a reference type - in this case, it holds a list of strings. 
            A string is a primitive value/ type as you learned but this doesn't affect the array. 
            Arrays are always reference types.

    <!-- 
        - Behind the scene, JavaScript has to store the values assigned to properties or variable in memory.
        - JavaScript knows two types of memory: The Stack and the Heap.

        - The STACK is essentially an easy-to-access memory that simply manages its items as a - well - stack. 
        Only items for which the size is known in advance can go onto the stack. This is the case for numbers, strings, booleans.

        - The HEAP is a memory for items of which you can't pre-determine the exact size and structure. 
        Since objects and arrays can be mutated and change at runtime, they have to go into the heap therefore.

        For each heap item, the exact address is stored in a pointer which points at the item in the heap. 
        This pointer in turn is stored on the stack.

    <!-- 
        Strange Behavior of "Reference Types"
            The fact that only pointers are stored on the stack for reference types matters a lot!

            var person = { name: 'Max' }
            - A pointer to the person object is stored in the variable. The same would be the case for the hobbies array.

        var person = { name: 'Max' }
        var newPerson = person
        newPerson.name = 'Anna'
        console.log(person.name) // What does this line print?
        - You'll see 'Anna' in the console!

            - Because you never copied the person object itself to newPerson. 
            You only copied the pointer! It still points at the same address in memory though. 
            Hence changing newPerson.name also changes person.name because newPerson points at the exactly same object!

        var hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking']
        var copiedHobbies = hobbies
        copiedHobbies.push('Music')
        console.log(hobbies[2]) // What does this line print?
        - This prints 'Music' - for the exact same reason as stated above.

        How to copy Actual Value?
            - You basically need to construct a new object or array and immediately fill it 
            with the properties or elements of the old object or array.
     -->
    
    <!-- 
        Two Most Popular Approaches for Array:
            1. Use the slice() method
                - slice() is a standard array method provided by JavaScript.
                var hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking']
                var copiedHobbies = hobbies.slice()
                    - It basically returns a new array which contains all elements of the old element, 
                    starting at the starting index you passed (and then up to the max number of elements you defined). 
                    If you just call slice(), without arguments, you get a new array with all elements of the old array.

            2. Use the spread operator
                - If you're using ES6+, you can use the spread operator.
                var hobbies = ['Sports', 'Cooking']
                var copiedHobbies = [...hobbies]
                    - Here, you also create a new array (manually, by using []) and you then use the spread operator (...) 
                    to "pull all elements of the old array out" and add them to the new array.
     -->

     <!-- 
        For Objects:
            1. Object.assign()
            var person = { name: 'Max' }
            var copiedPerson = Object.assign({}, person)
                - This syntax creates a new object (the {} part) and assigns all properties of the old object (the second argument) 
                to that newly created one. This creates a copy.

            2. Just as with arrays, you can also use the spread operator on objects.
            var person = { name: 'Max' }
            var copiedPerson = { ...person }
                - This will also create a new object (because you used { }) and will then pull all properties of person out of it, 
                into the brand-new objects.
      -->

      <!-- 
          The memo method tells React that whenever the app component change it should go to the component 
          that is declared to the memo and compare the new prop values to the previous prop values.
