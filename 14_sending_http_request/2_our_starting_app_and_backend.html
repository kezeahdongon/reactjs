    <!-- 
        - Modern web development heavily relies on APIs. 
        No matter if you're building a frontend web app (e.g. with Angular or React) 
        or if you're building a mobile app - you typically need some backend to which 
        you can send data and from which you can retrieve data.

        - Web APIs act as such backends.
        
        - When it comes to building them, you typically got two main options: 
        REST APIs and GraphQL APIs.
