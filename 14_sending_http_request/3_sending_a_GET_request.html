        What is a fetch API?
            The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline, 
            such as requests and responses. It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, 
            logical way to fetch resources asynchronously across the network.
