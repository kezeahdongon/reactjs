** Adding authentication to react app

    * Authentication is needed if content should be protected 
        (not accessible by everyone)

        * two-step process:
            1. get access/permission
            2. send request to protected resource

        * getting permission
            -> Client (Browser) -> Request (with user credentials) -> Server -> Response (yes/no) ->

    * How does authentication work?
        - we can't just save and use the "yes"
        - we could send a false "yes" to the server to request protected data
        - there are two approach we can use to authenticate
            - Server-side sessions
                - is a very traditional approach of handling authentication and 
                they are a great approach of handling authentication.
                - with server-side session, once a server grants you access that 
                server stores a unique identier for your client.
                - store unique identifier on server, send same identifier to client.
                - client sends identifier along with  requests to protected resources.

            - Authentication token
                - create (but not store) "permission" token on server, send token to client.
                - client sends token along with request to protected resources.
