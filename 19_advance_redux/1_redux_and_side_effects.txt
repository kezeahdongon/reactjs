- Reducers must be PURE, SIDE-EFFECT FREE, SYNCHRONOUS functions.
- your reducer functions should take some inputs in the case of redux reducer the 
(old state and the action) and produce some outputs 
Input (Old State + Action) >>> Output (New State)

- Where should side-effects and async tasks be executed?
    - inside the components (e.g. useEffect())
        if you use this... you can set aside redux.
    - inside the action creators
        action creator allows us to run asynchrounous or generally or side-effect code
