** Fat Reducers vs Fat Components vs Fat Actions
    - Where should our logic (code) go? 
        - Synchronous, side-effect free code
            - prefer reducers
            - avoid action creators or components
            ex: data transformation
        - Async code or code with side-effects
            - prefer action cfreators or components
            - never use reducers
