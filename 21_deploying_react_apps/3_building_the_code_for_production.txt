** Buildong the code for production

    1. go to the 'package.json' file and do to the "scripts" and check for the 'build'.

    2. run [npm run build] in the terminal, this will transform the code and shrink it 
    as much as possible and it will not start a server. It will create a new folder
    'build' where you can find all the code you'll need to deploy. The 'static' folder
    holds the optimized css codes and optimized js codes.

        NOTE: you should never change the files inside of this folder.
