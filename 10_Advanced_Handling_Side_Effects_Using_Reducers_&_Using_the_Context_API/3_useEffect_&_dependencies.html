        - By using useEffect() Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render.
        React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our “effect”), 
        and call it later after performing the DOM updates.

        - Dependencies are array items provided as the optional second argument of the useEffect call. 
        Array values must be from the component scope (i.e., props, state, context, or values derived from the aforementioned). 
        After execution of every effect, scheduling of new effects occurs based on every effect's dependencies.

        - useEffect() is used to handle the side effects.
        - Often side effects are: 
            - http requests
            - listen to every key stroke and saved that entered data and trigger another function in response. 
            (side effect of the user entering data)
