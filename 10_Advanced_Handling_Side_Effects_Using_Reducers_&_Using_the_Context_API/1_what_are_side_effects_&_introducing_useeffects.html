            - Working w/ (Side) Effects

        What is an "Effect" (or a "Side Effect")?
            Main Job: Render UI & React to User Input
                - Evaluate & Render JSX
                - Manage State & Props
                - React to (User) Events & Input
                - Re-evaluate Component upon State & Prop Changes
                NOTE: This is all "baked into" React via the "tools" and features.
                
            Side Effects: Anything Else
                - Store Data in Browser Storage
                - Send Http Request to Backend Servers
                - Set & Manage Timers
                NOTE: These tasks must happen outside of the normal component evaluation and render cycle 
                    --especially that they might block/delay rendering.

    <!--
        Handling Side Effects w/ the useEffect() Hook
            useEffect(() => { ... }, [ dependencies ]);

                () => {...},
                    - A function that should be executed AFTER every component evaluation IF the specified dependencies change.
                    NOTE: Your side effect code goes to this function.

                [dependencies]
                    - Dependencies of this effect --the function only runs if the dependencies change.
                    NOTE: Specify your dependencies of your function here.
