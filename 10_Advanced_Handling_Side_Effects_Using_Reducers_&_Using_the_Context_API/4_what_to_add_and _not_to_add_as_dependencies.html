        - There is no need to add state updating functions: 
        React guarantees that those functions never change, 
        hence you don't need to add them as dependencies.

        - There is also no need to add "built-in" APIs or functions like fetch(), 
        localStorage etc (functions and features built-into the browser and hence available globally): 
        These browser APIs / global functions are not related to the React component render cycle and they also never change.

        - there is no need to add variables or functions you might've defined OUTSIDE of your components 
        (e.g. if you create a new helper function in a separate file): 
        Such functions or variables also are not created inside of a component function 
        and hence changing them won't affect your components 
        (components won't be re-evaluated if such variables or functions change and vice-versa).

        - You must add all "things" you use in your effect function if those "things" could change 
        because your component (or some parent component) re-rendered. 
        That's why variables or state defined in component functions, props or functions defined in component functions
        have to be added as dependencies!

        // example:

        import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
 
        let myTimer;
        
        const MyComponent = (props) => {
        const [timerIsActive, setTimerIsActive] = useState(false);
        
        const { timerDuration } = props; // using destructuring to pull out specific props values
        
        useEffect(() => {
            if (!timerIsActive) {
            setTimerIsActive(true);
            myTimer = setTimeout(() => {
                setTimerIsActive(false);
            }, timerDuration);
            }
        }, [timerIsActive, timerDuration]);
        };

        // in this example:
            timerIsActive 
                - is added as a dependency because it's component state that may change when the component changes 
                (e.g. because the state was updated)

            timerDuration 
                - is added as a dependency because it's a prop value of that component 
                - so it may change if a parent component changes that value (causing this MyComponent component to re-render as well)

            setTimerIsActive 
                - is NOT added as a dependency because it's that exception: 
                State updating functions could be added but don't have to be added since React guarantees that the 
                functions themselves never change

            myTimer 
                - is NOT added as a dependency because it's not a component-internal variable 
                (i.e. not some state or a prop value) - it's defined outside of the component and changing it 
                (no matter where) wouldn't cause the component to be re-evaluated

            setTimeout 
                - is NOT added as a dependency because it's a built-in API (built-into the browser) 
                - it's independent from React and your components, it doesn't change
