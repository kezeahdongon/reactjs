    <title>Introducing React Context (Context API)</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!--
        The React Context API is a way for a React app to effectively produce global variables that can be passed around. 
        This is the alternative to "prop drilling" or moving props from grandparent to child to parent, and so on.
        
        React Context is a method to pass props from parent to child component(s), by storing the props in a store(similar in Redux) and 
        using these props from the store by child component(s) without actually passing them manually at each level of the component tree.

        The Context API can be used to share data with multiple components, without having to pass data through props manually. 
        For example, some use cases the Context API is ideal for: theming, user language, authentication, etc.

        There are four steps to using React context:
            1. Create context using the createContext method.
            2. Take your created context and wrap the context provider around your component tree.
            3. Put any value you like on your context provider using the value prop.
            4. Read that value within any component by using the context consumer.

        COMPONENT TREES & COMPONENT DEPENDENCIES

                            <App />

        <Auth />            <Shop />            <Cart />

        <LoginForm />       <Products />        
        [Login]
                            <Product />
                            [Add to cart]

        Note:
            - we might need the LOGIN to access the <Shop/> or the <Cart/>.
            - ADD TO CART might be needed to know what is added in the <Cart/>.
            *but there is no direct connection from <LoginForm/> to (<Shop/> and/or <Cart/>) 
            and <Product/> does not have direct connection to <Cart/>.
            *instead: use Props & Functions passed via Props.
            - so we pass the LOGIN from <LoginForm/> to <Auth/> to <App/> to <Shop/>
            - and we pass the ADD TO CART from <Product/> to <Products/> to <Shop/> to <App/> to <Cart/>.
