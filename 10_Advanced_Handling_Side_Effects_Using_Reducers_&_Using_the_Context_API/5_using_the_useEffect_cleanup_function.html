        - The useEffect hook is built in a way that if we return a function within the method, 
        this function will execute when the component gets disassociated. 
        This is very useful because we can use it to remove unnecessary behavior or prevent memory leaking issues.

        So, if we want to cleanup a subscription, the code would look like this:
            useEffect(() => {
                API.subscribe()
                return function cleanup() {
                    API.unsubscribe()
                }
            });
    -->

        What is Debouncing in react JS?
            - A Debouncing Events in ReactJS will allow you to call a function 
            that ensures that a time-consuming task does not fire so often. 
            It's a function that takes a function as a parameter and wraps that function 
            in a closure and returns it so this new function displays the “wait for a bit” behavior.
