    <title>useReducer vs useState for State Management</title>

    <!--
        When to use useReducer() and useState()?
            - useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic 
            that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. 
            useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates 
            because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

            - useState should be used only inside functional components. 
            useState is the way if we need an internal state and don't need to implement more complex logic such as lifecycle methods.

        useState()
            - The main state management "tool".
            - Great for independent pieces of state/data.
            - Great if state updates are easy and limited to a few kinds of updates.

        useReducer()
            - Great if you need "more power".
                it can contain complex state update logics where you are always guaranteed to work with the latest state snapshotand 
                where you can move that potentially more complex logic out of the component function body into the separate function 
                reducer.
            - Should be considered if you have related pieces of state/data
            - Can be helpful if you have more complex state updates.

        You can certainly also handle cases where useReducer will be good to just use useState when combining with useEffect. 
        Sometimes, using useReducer just might be more eligant or simplier. On the other hand, you should not always use useReducer 
        because often that would be overkill if you have just a simple state that just switches between two different values.
