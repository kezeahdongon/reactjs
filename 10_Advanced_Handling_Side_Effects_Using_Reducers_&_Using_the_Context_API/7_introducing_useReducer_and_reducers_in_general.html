    <title>Introducing useReducer & Reducers in General</title>
</head>

    <!--
        Introducing useReducer() for State Management
            - useReducer is a React hook function that accepts a reducer function, and an initial state.
            This hook function returns an array with 2 values. The first one is the state value, 
            and the second value is the dispatch function which is further used to trigger an action 
            with the help of array destructuring.

            What is useReducer used for?
                - useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic 
                that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. 
                useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates 
                because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.    

            >> sometimes, you have more complex state -for example if it got multiple state, 
                multiple ways of changing it or dependencies to other states.

                >> useState() then often becomes hard or error-prone to use -it's easy to write bad, 
                    inefficient or buggy code in such scenarios.

                    >> useReducer() can be a replacement for useState() if you need "more powerful state management".

        Understanding useReducer()
            const [state, dispatchFn] = useReducer(reducerFn, initialState, initFn);

            state
                the state snapshot used in the component re-render/re-evaluation cycle.
            
            dispatchFn
                a function that can be used to dispatch a new action (i.e. trigger an update of the state)

            reducerFn
                (prevState, action) => newState
                a function that is triggered automatically once an action is dispatched (via dispatchFn())
                - it receives the latest state snapshot and should return the new updated state.
            
            initialState
                the initial state 

            initFn
                a function to set the initial state programmatically.
