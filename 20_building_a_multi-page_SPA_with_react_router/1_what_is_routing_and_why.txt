    What is Routing?
        - React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the 
        navigation among views of various components in a React Application, 
        allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL.

        - The application will contain three components: home component, about a 
        component, and contact component.

    Building SPAs
        - When building complex user interfaces, we typically build SINGLE PAGE 
        APPLICATIONS (SPAs).

        - Only one initial HTML request & response

        - Page (URL) changes are then handled by client-side (React) code.
        It changes the visible content without fetching a new HTML file.
