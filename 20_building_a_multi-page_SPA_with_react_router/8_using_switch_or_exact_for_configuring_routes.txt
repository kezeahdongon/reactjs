** Dynamic routes and route parameters are another crusial feature of react router which 
you will use in any applications you are building. 

** Your URL basically works like a folder structure then new "subfolders" (= related pages)
add new segments.

** This is how router works:
    We define our routes but by default these routes are not parse such that only one of 
    them are loaded at the same time instead all routes that match the current prop will be
    loaded. 

    - solution to this is using the {Switch} from 'react-reouter-dom' so that only one in
    the options will be choosen.
