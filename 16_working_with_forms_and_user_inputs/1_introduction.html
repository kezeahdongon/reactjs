        HANDLING FORMS & USER INPUT
            Working with Values, Validation, & State

        What's Complex About Forms?
            Forms ans Inputs can assume different states
                -one or more inputs are invalid
                    - Output input-specific error message & highlight problematic inputs
                    - ensure form can't be submitted/saved
                -all inputs are valid
                    - allow form to be submitted/saved

        When to Validate?
            - when form is Submitted
                - allows the user to enter a valid value before warning
                - avoid unnecessary warning but maybe present feedback "too late"
            - when a input is losing focus
                - allows the user to enter a valid value before warning
                - very useful for untouched forms
            - on every keystroke
                - warns the user before even had a chance of entering valid values
                - if applied only on invalid inputs, has the potential of providing more direct feedback
