    **Key Feature 1: Built-in Server-side rendering

        - server-side rendering is all about preparing the content of a page on a server 
        instead of in the client.

        - automatic page prerendering: great for SEO and initial load

        - Blending client-side and server-side: fetch data on the server and render 
        finished pages
