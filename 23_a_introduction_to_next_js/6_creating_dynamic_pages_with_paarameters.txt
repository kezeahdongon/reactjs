    **Creating Dynamic Pages ( with parameters )

        - we use square brackets [] in the file name in front of the extension.
        - if you have square brackets in your file name like this [].js
            it tells NextJS that tghis will be a dynamic page
            so that it will  be loaded for different values in your path
            and then you can add an identifier between those square brackets 
            where the identifier name is totally up to you.

        - when you visit the site our-domain.com/news/anything 
            it will land you on the details page
